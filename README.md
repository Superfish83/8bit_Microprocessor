# 8-bit Microprocessor

This repository archives an microprocessor design we wrote in Verilog, for the final lab project of SNU CSE Logic Design (2025-1) course.

We implemented an 8-bit Microprocessor that supports 4 instructions (add, load, store, jump), and some additional features.

For detailed description of the design, refer to`report.pdf`.
